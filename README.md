This is a project looking at expression differences between high and low elevation populations of Tibetan chickens.

Using publically available data from: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77166

FROM A METHYLATION STUDY BY SAME AUTHORS.
The experiment eggs were collected from 2 populations raising at highland, Tibetan chicken (TC) and Lhasa White chicken (LWC), and 2 populations raising at lowland, Chahua chicken (CC) and Tibetan chicken at Beijing (BTC). T

WHICH MEANS THAT OUR SAMPLES ARE:
TC1: Linzhi Tibetan chicken_embryonic heart 		HIGHLAND
TC2: Linzhi Tibetan chicken_embryonic heart		HIGHLAND
LWC1: Lhasa White_embryonic heart    		     HIGHLAND	
LWC2: Lhasa White_embryonic heart			HIGHLAND
CH1: Chahua chicken_embryonic heart			LOWLAND
CH2: Chahua chicken_embryonic heart			LOWLAND
WL_D1: White leghom_embryonic heart			LOWLAND?
WL_D2: White leghom_embryonic heart			LOWLAND?
